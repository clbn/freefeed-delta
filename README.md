# FreeFeed Delta

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

Delta is an unofficial [FreeFeed](https://freefeed.net) client.

You can use the app at https://delta.applied.creagenics.com/, run it locally on your 
computer, or even host it on your own server.

## Running locally

After cloning the repo, switch to the app folder and install the dependencies 
(you only need to do it once):

```
$ yarn
```

Now, run the development server:

```
$ yarn dev
```

By default, it uses production FreeFeed API (`https://freefeed.net/v1/...`), 
so you can sign in with your FF credentials and socialize with your friends 
right away.

## Building for production
